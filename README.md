High-accuracy heading angle is significant for estimating autonomous vehicle attitude. A dual-antenna GNSS receiver is added to this study to improve the vehicle heading angle accuracy. By dual-antenna orientation algorithm, GNSS heading angle is added as a measurement variable in the integrated navigation system based on Kalman filter in addition to position and velocity. When none of the GNSS receiver data was available, barometer is added to the traditional GNSS/INS integrated navigation system to enhance the reliability of the system. Through the fusion of the INS error equation with the measurement equation, a dual-antenna GNSS/Barometer/INS integration are realized. The proposed method has been validated in the open and occluded environment.

In the local navigation frame (n-frame), x-axis, y-axis and z-axis point east, north and up respectively. The vehicle coordinate system (b-frame) is the right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected to the vehicle with x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis in the vehicleâ€™s right, front, and up directions, respectively. Original data from experiments in open and occluded environment have been uploaded.
